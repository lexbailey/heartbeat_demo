# Heartbeat game demo

This is a prebuilt version of a [very] short game called Heartbeat, made by Lex for the December 2021 DevSoc Game Jam at the University of York.

Although I would like to make this truly open source, the code that this is buit from is kinda awful, because it was thrown together in under 48 hours for a game jam.


# Playing the game

This game runs in your browser.

If this git repo is still in the right place on github, then you can visit https://danieljabailey.github.io/heartbeat_demo/ in any modern-ish browser and play the game.

Alternatively, if you want to play it locally, just run a basic http server that can serve static files, and have it serve this directory.

For example, for a temporary thing, just run this command inside this directory to use the http server that comes with python:

    python3 -m http.server
